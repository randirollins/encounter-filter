# encounter-filter
What influences the level of parasite infection in host species? Combes' filter concept suggests two things: 1) the rate of encounter with the parasite, and 2) how compatibility  the host is for the parasite. 

This project evaluated the host-parasite 'encounter filter' by investigating the varied levels of rat lungworm infection in host snail species by assessing the species' coprophagic tendencies.


This repository contains a script called 'Food_preference_analyses' which has been cleaned and condensed and contains code for each analysis and boxplots of the data.
The xlsx. file 'Food pref data' contains the food preference data for four snail species used to conduct the analyses, and is ready to import into the script.


*Additional information*: rat lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis) is a zoonotic parasite that causes eosinophilic meningitis in humans, and can be deadly. Other vertebrates, such as dogs, horses, primates, and birds, can also become ill if infected. The zoonotic rat lungworm parasite completes it's life cycle in rats and snails. Snails acquire the parasite largely by ingesting rat feces containing the parasite. Although many different species of snails can serve as host to the rat lungworm parasite, snail species vary greatly in their infection prevalence and intensity. To understand the what drives this variation in infection, we studied the foof preference of several species with known, and varied, rat lungworm infection levels in the wild. Because snails become infected by ingested infected rat feces, we evaluated each species' coprophagic tendency, and compared this to the species' documented infection prevalence values.
